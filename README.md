Based on derived metrics like [xT](https://www.hudl.com/blog/possession-value-models-explained) for play buildup in soccer game flow, we aimed to derive expected possession values based on start and end action types, location statistics, and conditional probabilities for NBA games.

Data was gathered using [hoopR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hoopR/index.html), with completed datasets available in the *datasets/* folder.
